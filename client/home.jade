  | For the prototype phase we are using our virtual testcurrency MANGOS to demonstrate the power of a "relational currency", by removing the concept of dept and embracing a universal basic income, inspired by the
  a(href="http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/index.html") Theory of Relational Money.
  | If you want to learn more about the concept of Relational Money and Demurrage Fee get engaged on

  h3 Information & Overview
  | A relational currency is tightly coupled to its members and money distribution is based on the amount of
  b real and unique
  | people in a network of trust, a reason proper identification is indispensable. For simplicity in the beginning, you will be verified once someone else is sending you some mangos. Make sure to renew every 10 years your verification or you will loose all your Mangos. On the long run this will be exchanged with a more complex and true webOfTrust certification method.
