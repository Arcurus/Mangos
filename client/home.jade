  | For the prototype phase we are using our virtual testcurrency MANGOS to demonstrate the power of a "relational currency", by removing the concept of dept and embracing a universal basic income, inspired by the
  a(href="http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/index.html") Theory of Relational Money.
  | If you want to learn more about the concept of Relational Money and Demurrage Fee get engaged on

  h3 Information & Overview
  | A relational currency is tightly coupled to its members and money distribution is based on the amount of real and unique people in a network of trust, a reason proper identification is indispensable. For simplicity in the beginning, we have a 2 stage verification model. Level 0, every user that is signung up with an anonymous username. Level 1, every user that is signing up with Facebook. If signing up with facebook, you are able to get verfied, and verify other people. Make sure to get verified by other members every 5 years (~17 real days with current settings). On the long run this will be exchanged with a more complex webOfTrust certification method, which is being discussed here:

      .header Speed
      |  In this prototype we use for the demonstration purpose a speeding up factor, setting 1min to a 1sec interval. So 10 virtual years is about 1 real month
